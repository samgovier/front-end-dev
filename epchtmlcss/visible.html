    <h1>Learning to Control Visibility in HTML</h1>
    <p id="visible">
        This paragraph was created to demonstrate controlling the visibilty using CSS. Position
        the mouse pointer over this paragraph
        <img id="face1" src="./images/face.png" alt="face symbol" height="32" width="32" />
        and see the face appear. Notice how when the face is not visible it still leaves
        room for it.
    </p>
    <p id="display">
        This paragraph was created to demonstrate controlling the display using CSS. Position
        the mouse pointer over this paragraph
        <img id="face2" src="./images/face.png" alt="face symbol" height="32" width="32" />
        and see the face appear. Notice how when the face becomes visible it adjusts the
        paragraph to display it.

    <p id="offscreen">
        This paragraph was created to demonstrate negative positioning using CSS to position
