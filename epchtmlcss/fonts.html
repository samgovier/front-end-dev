    <h1>A heading 1</h1>
    <h2>A heading 2</h2>
    <p>
        a normal paragraph

        Code looks best in a monospace font

        At the prompt enter <span class="enterdata">10</span> and press enter.

        At the prompt <span class="prompt">Enter name:</span> enter a value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an <span class="under">example</span> of a bad choice.
    </p>
    <p class="right">
        this is a right justified paragraph
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
        This is an indented paragraph just like they used to do back in the day when you
        always started a paragraph indented. Today they usually just leave a blank line
        between paragraphs instead of indenting the first line of the paragraph.
    </p>
    <p class="nowrap">
        This is a long sentence that we don't want to wrap like normal so a bottom scroll
        bar will appear. Notice what happens to the right justified paragraph as you scroll
        and resize the window. This property can be helpful in table formatting.
