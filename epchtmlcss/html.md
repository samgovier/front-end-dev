hi :)

HTML Overview
===

What is HTML?
---

__HyperText Markup Language (HTML)__ is used to specify the content of a web page. It has become ubiquitous because:
* It's fast to write
* It's descriptive
* It's easy to parse, both visually by a person and programmatically by a computer
* It decouples content from how it is used, making it easy to re-style.

The __HyperText__ portion refers to the fact that HTML documents can include hyperlinks to other related documents. The __Markup Language__ portion states that the language is not for programming- it's for markup.

### What is a Markup Language?

A system for annotating parts of a document to provide additional context. One part could be marked for the title, another a heading, and another a paragraph. The code has to be syntactically distinguishable so it's not presented to the user.

Web Site Organization
---

* Root Directory contains the starting page.
* Subdirectories are for organizing pages.
    * `./dirName` moves down a directory
    * `../` moves up a directory
    * `/` refers to the root of a website
* All images should be placed in a shared directory
* No spaces in file or path names. If necessary, you can encode spaces in a URL using `%20`.

Document Type Declaration
---

* Required. Must be first line in file, even before comments
* Declares the DTD, Document Type Definition, versions used for the document
* Used to check the document for validity
* Affects the rendering of the page

__HTML5__:  

    <!DOCTYPE html>

__XHTML Strict__:  

    <!DOCTYPE  html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

__XHTML Transitional__:  

    <!DOCTYPE  html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" >

Elements
===

The syntax for elements is as follows:

    <tagname attr1="val1" attr2="val2" ... >
        content
    </tagname>

OR

    <tagname attr1="val1" attr2="val2" ... />

Tags that are capable of containing content should never be terminated using the second shorthand. This can break some browsers.

Rules and Conventions
---
* All tag names are lowercase
* All elements must be terminated with a closing tag
* Use the second shorthand for empty elements that don't have content
* Some tags have required attributes, others are optional
* All attribute values must be in quotes

Minimal HTML Page
---
An empty HTML page must include:
1. A document type
2. Required elements in a hierarchy (one element in another, nesting)

Example:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Web Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Content Here
    </body>
    </html>

So you must have a document type, the html element, containing a head and body, and the head must have a title.

`html` tag - Root of all HTML documents. All other elements are contained in it. Placed just after the document type declaration.

`head` tag - Defines the header portion of the document. Contains information about the document that's not part of the actual content. Must include the `title` element.

`meta` tag - Provides additional information about the document: this would come first in the header, and identifies content type and character set.
* `http-equiv="text"` indicates what will be described in the content attribute
* `content="text"` required, specifies the value of the meta element.

Eg:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />

`title` tag - required element of the header. Should be clear and descriptive. This is typically displayed in the browser tab.

`body` tag - Contains the document's content, which will be displayed visually.

`p` tag - Denotes a paragraph. May contain text and inline elements- not other block elements.

__Element Types__
---

*Block Elements* - items that are followed by a line break, may contain text, other block elements, inline elements. Most are containers for other elements. This includes: `p, h1, h2, ol, ul, blockquote, table, div`

*Inline Elements* - exist inline with text, must be contained in a block element, may only contain text or other inline elements. No implied line breaks before or after. Includes: `br, em, strong, a, img, span`

Block Element Examples
---

`h#` tag - in the body, specifies a heading that briefly describes the section that follows. 1 is the biggest, 6 is the smallest. They should appear in order.


`blockquote` tag - Enclosed text is a quote block with 1+ paragraphs. Requires at least one block element. The block may be rendered indented.
* you can add `cite="URL"` that sources the quote, not visible

`br` tag - inserts a line break. Always an empty element: `<br />`

`em` tag - emphasized text. Usually renders in italics.

`strong` tag - strongly emphasized text. Usually renders in bold.

Generic Elements
---

These elements don't have any intrinsic styling or meaning associated with them, they're just used to mark sections of content to either style them with CSS or manipulate them with JavaScript.

`div` tag - generic __block__ element

`span` tag - generic __inline__ element

Attributes - these attributes are common to all elements.  
* `id` - Assigns a unique identifying name to the element. Must be unique among all IDs in a document. Can be used to select specific elements to style.
* `class` - Assigns one or more classification names to the element separated by spaces, elements in *. Can be used to apply the same style to multiple elements.

Special Characters
===

Certain characters cannot be directly written because they have special meaning in HTML syntax. These characters need to be properly escaped to be safely included in content. Other characters have special behavior or a special glyph.

Escape Characters
---

To display the following characters, use the following HTML code.

| Character  | Code     |
|-|-|
| <          | `&lt;`   |
| >          | `&gt;`   |
| &          | `&amp;`  |
| "          | `&quot;` |
| Â©          | `&copy;` |
| space (no break) | `&nbsp;` |

Numeric Character Reference (NCR)
---
Characters can also be inserted using the hexadecimal number from the character-set table.
* `&#xhhhh;` where hhhh is the hexadecimal equivalent of the character
    * `&#x20;` is a space
    * `&#x27;` is an apostrophe

Hyperlinks
===
`a` is for anchor. This is used for creating hyperlinks.

Attributes:
* `href="URL"` - specifies the destination URL
* `title="text"` - textual description of destination: displayed as a tooltip and can be read by screen readers.
* `id="name"` - create a named anchor that is used in a URL, docname#idName or just #idName in same document
* `target="text"` - specifies the name of the window where the target document should be displayed. "_blank" opens a new browser window (not valid on strict XHTML)

Link lables should be kept concise and meaningful. Titles should provide more information.
